        <h1>p5.js for Designers</h1>
        <p>
          Most design today is dynamic: displaying live data and reacting to user input. Designers in this environment must learn to think, not just visually, but programmatically as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creative coding offers a fun way to explore programming, whether or not you intend on writing your own software. My hope is that even limited experience trying to implement design ideas using code will sensitize designers to the complex—and <em>potentially</em> generative—relationship between design and technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following is written for people with little to no experience with web development. It's for anyone who’d like to make cool, visual interactions. <strong>Having said that,</strong> I should mention that this is <em>not</em> intended to be an introduction to HTML, CSS, or even JavaScript. You will use JavaScript, but I will try to explain only what you need to build each mini project. You will also encounter some geometry (it’s unavoidable in creative coding), but if you disassociate math from the smell of homework, you may even find it enjoyable!
        </p>
        <aside>
          <strong>Tip:</strong> If you encounter an example you cannot understand or your code fails to execute, I suggest pasting the code into <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">chatGPT</a> and asking what the code means or why it is not executing. While there are many tasks for which “A.I.” remains inappropriate or faddish; for this one it shines.
        </aside>
        <p>
          One last thing… if you are brand new to coding, don’t feel bad if JavasScript looks like gobbledygook to you at first. It happens to everyone.
