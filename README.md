# Skills by Greg Skiano

A collection of project-based guides for whatever interests me.

## Local development

You just need an internet connection and a webserver to serve these files.

If you have python, try:

```bash
$ cd ~/path/to/this/code
$ python3 -m http.server
```

Or you could install nodeâ€™s [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) globally.

```bash
$ cd ~/path/to/this/code
$ http-server . -c-1
```

## Deployment

All the paths should match because the directory matches the eventual github pages route, which means all the paths can be absolute (yay!!)
